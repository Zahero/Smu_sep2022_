# Unit 21 Homework: Charity Funding Predictor


Once the data was cleaned our heat map shows that we have some negative and
positive correlation in our features.. The xgb boost model is the best one it shows
no signs of overfitting with a higher AUC but lower brier score and a comparable f1
score of .69 on the test set. However after building my 2nd neural network and
adding some hidden layers it was clear this model would be the best with an AUC of
.78 and a higher accuracy score.
